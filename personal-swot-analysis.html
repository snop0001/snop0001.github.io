          <h3 class="blog-post">Strenghts:</h3>
          <br>
               <ol class="blog-post">
                <li> Curious - I love to explore and research different subjects from computers to psychology etc. </li> 
                <br>
                <li> Social - I love getting to know people and other cultures </li> 
                <br>
                <li> Detail oriented and good at problem solving - my previous experience with programming made me think in algorithms
                and pay attention to small details in general, life situations and in tasks.</li>
               </ol>

            <h3 class="blog-post">Weaknesses:</h3>
            <ol class="blog-post">
               <li> Insecure - I sometimes feel like I am not qualified enough for certain positions or that I am 
                less good than others. </li> 
                <br>
                <li>Too detail oriented - it can be a strength sometimes, but also a weakness because I tend to focus too much on the 
                    small details rather than the big picture.</li>
                 <br>
                <li>Anxious and nervous - I tend to get stressed and want to complete a lot in a short period of time, which sometimes
                    results in me putting a lot on myself. </li> 
            </ol>

        <section> 
             <h3 class="blog-post">Opportunities:</h3>
                <p class="blog-post">Because of my insecurities in combination with me being very studious and self disciplined, I will spend extra time on studying and perfecting my projects. My curiosity leads me to explore and learn further than needed. Being social helps me get along with my teammates, colleagues and fellow students, and to be able to properly contribute in group tasks. My strong attention to details helps me to encounter and solve problems in my personal and career life. And my anxiety helps me pay extra attention to things around me,it pushes me to finish tasks in the right deadline and because I am aware I suffer from this I know to plan my schedule and divide my time for all my projects.

             <h3 class="blog-post">Threats:</h3>
                <p class="blog-post">I will need as well to combine my integration exams to the Netherlands alongside my studies and get used to a different country since I moved here only this month, but I don't think it will cause a problem or be an obstacle. I don't think my weaknesses will prevent me from succeeding since I am very motivated and I will work hard to get passed them and use them as much as I can for my advantage like I wrote in the "Opportunities" section.
