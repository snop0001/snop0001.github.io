        <h2 class="blog-Post"> First Feedback on my "Who Am I?" assignment:</h2>
        <br>
          <p class="blog-post">  
            I received Daphne's feedback in person last week.
            Her feedback divided into two parts, one about my motivation for the studies and one about my personal development.
            About my motivation she told me it is better to focus on the story behind my love for programming and coding, which 
            for me it is the creation of something new that did not exist before, something I can see as a product and as a result for
            for my effort.
            She said my personal development will be to focus on my stress and overthinking. She said it will be good for me to practice 
            how to take breaks at certain hours and limit my work hours so I can enjoy other things too and not worn myself out.
            We disscussed that maybe together with my fellow students we will send a message at a certain hour obliging ourselves to take a break
            and stop working. 
            I am looking forward to managing and helping myself to be more relaxed and laid back then I am right now, so I will be able to produce 
            good results and succeed in my studies together with having fun and leisure time as well.
