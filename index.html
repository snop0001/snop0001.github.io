        <h2> Why did I choose ICT for my studies and future profession?</h2>
        <p> 
          I am looking forward to get back into programming which is what made me fall in love with computers in the
          first place,
          learning more languages and about all the other possibilities of IT. My main reason for enjoying programming
          is the possibility of creating something new, writing a code from scratch and tailor it to be able to do what we need
          it to or what is required. Only the thought of something I created being out there that wasnt there before makes me so happy, I see
          it as a way of leaving my mark in the world. 
          Originally I started being interested in computers thanks to my older brother, he started studying Java and programming 
          and I saw him creating his first project for school, I sat next to him and watched how he created a program that will 
          take information of patients and book them in schedule of doctors appointments. It peaked my interest and he said I 
          should study this too if it is interesting to me. 
           Another reason is that I love using computers, they are such a big important part of our day to day lives, and I would love 
          to be part of this industry in a way that I as well will create programs that will help the world or even just make it fun 
          just like building games from scratch. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> Why do I believe I will succeed in this study field?</h2>
        <p> Because of my passion for computers in general for both professional reasons and fun and for programing
          in particular, I believe I will put a lot of effort and invest a lot of my time to achieve the goals I want in
          this field.
          I know I am very commited and hardworking so even if I will struggle I will do my best to improve and learn
          more and better.
          I have different experiance in the field because Computers always interested me, at school, I choose to focus on programming (I studies Java, assembler and
          visual basic which we used to build a database). Later when I entered the military service which is obligatory in my
          country, I did exams to enter the computer subjects, there I was sent to a course where I studied to become a Network
          manager, so I was introduced more towards the hardware part of computers. I ended up serving in the rest of my service
          as a deputy commander of a computer center, project manager and as an infrastructure manager in a Data Center.
          Since my release I have been working in IT support where I assisted clients with problems. 
          I am looking forward to programing and working in teams with other students and encounter more of the social
          view of coding which I still did not have experiance with.
        </p>
