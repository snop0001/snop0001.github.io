        <h2> Why did I choose ICT for my studies and future profession?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am looking forward to get back into <strong> programming which is what made me fall in love with computers </strong> in the
          first place, learning more languages and about all the other possibilities of IT. </p>
        <br>
        <p> <strong> My main reason for enjoying programming</strong>
          is the <strong>possibility of creating something new </strong>, writing a code from scratch and tailor it to be able to do what
          we need
          it to. <strong>Only the thought of something I created being out there </strong> that wasnt there before
          makes me so happy, I see
          it as a way of <strong> leaving my mark in the world. Hopefully one day I want to use it to make the world a better place.</strong>
          My other passion is psycology so eventually I want to use both of them to make psycological teraphy more acessible to more people all 
          over the world hopefully more afordable as well. <strong>The opportunity to improve the world using computers is endless in my eyes!</strong> </p>
        <br>
        <p> Originally I started being interested in computers thanks to my older brother, he started studying Java and
          programming
          and I saw him creating his first project for school, I sat next to him and watched how he created a program
          on his own,It peaked my interest that ever since did not stop growing. </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Why do I believe I will succeed in this study field?</h2>
        <br>
        <p> Because of my passion for computers in general for both professional reasons and fun and for programing
          in particular, I believe I will put a lot of effort and invest a lot of my time to achieve the goals I want in
          this field. </p>
          <br>
        <p> I know I am very commited and hardworking so even if I will struggle I will do my best to improve and learn
          more and better. </p>
          <br>
        <p> <strong> I have different experience in the field  </strong> because computers always interested me, at school, I choose to
          focus
          on programming <strong> (I studied Java, assembler and
          visual basic which we used to build a database).</strong></p>
          <br>

        <p>Later when I entered the military service which is obligatory
          in my
          country, I did exams to enter the computer subjects, there I was sent to a course where I studied to become a
          <strong> Network
          manager </strong>, so I was introduced more towards the hardware part of computers. I ended up serving in the rest of my
          service
          as a <strong> deputy commander, project manager and as an infrastructure manager in a Data Center.</strong>
        </p>
         <br>

        <p> Since my release I have been working in <strong> IT support where I assisted clients with problems.</strong>
          I am looking forward to programing and working in teams with other students and encounter more of the social
          view of coding which I still did not have experience with.
        </p>
