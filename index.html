        <h2> Why did I choose ICT for my studies and future profession?</h2>
        <p> Computers always interested me, at school, I choose to focus on programming (I studies Java, assembler and
          visual
          basic which we used to build a database). Later when I entered the military service which is obligatory in my
          country,
          I did exams to enter the computer subjects, there I was sent to a course where I studied to become a Network
          manager,
          so I was introduced more towards the hardware part of computers. I ended up serving in the rest of my service
          as a
          deputy commander of a computer center, project manager and as an infrastructure manager in a Data Center.
          Since my
          release I have been working in IT support where I assisted clients with problems.
          I am looking forward to get back into programming which is what made me fall in love with computers in the
          first place,
          learning more languages and about all the other possibilities of IT. My main reason for enjoying programming
          is the
          possibility of creating something new, writing a code from scratch and tailor it to be able to do what we need
          it to
          or what is required</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2> Why do I believe I will succeed in this study field?</h2>
        <p> Because of my passion for computers in general for both professional reasons and fun and for programing
          in particular, I believe I will put a lot of effort and invest a lot of my time to achieve the goals I want in
          this field.
          I know I am very commited and hardworking so even if I will struggle I will do my best to improve and learn
          more and better.
          I am looking forward to programing and working in teams with other students and encounter more of the social
          view of coding
          which I still did not have experiance with.
