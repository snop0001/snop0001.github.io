        <h2>Personal information</h2>
        <p> My name is Shirel Snopik I am 23 years old. I come originally from Israel, a very little country in the
          middle east.
          I speak 3.5 languages, Hebrew, Spanish, English and a bit of Dutch. I moved to the Netherlands to live with my
          Partner
          of the past 5 and a half years, I am looking forward to become a part of the Netherlands in general and
          especially part of the
          community here.
          I believe that by studying here and reserching programming which is a subject that was always close to my
          heart Ill be able
          to achive all my goals in this new country.
        </P>
        <br>
        <H2>Pre-education and subjects followed during previous education: </H2>
        <p> 6 years of Primary school and 6 of high school (among them 3 that included finals).
          Followed level 5 (the highest) of English and math. Choose 10 units of computer science and 5 units of
          physics.
          I did some courses in the university back in my hometown like relationship in psycology's eyes, quantitative
          thinking and academic english </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Extra-curricular activities</h2>
        <H3>Do you work/are you planning to work alongside your studies? What do you do in your spare time? How do you
          think
          you can combine this with studying? </H3>
        <p>Maybe I will want to work alongside my studies but it is not certain, I will need to as well focus on my
          Inburgeren Examen
          for the Netherlands during my studies, I hope to pass these tests in the upcoming year.
          In my spare time I enjoy mainly doing the following:</p>
        <ul class="hobbies">
          <li>Yoga</li>
          <li>meditations</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Gaming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also love to travel and get to know new locations especially now that I moved to the Netherlands. During my
          studies I tend to focus mainly on my studies
          so I need to learn to combine my other interests together with them to be able to feel more relaxed. I will
          probably combine my meditations, cooking and yoga
          before or after the study days and the rest of my hobbies more on the weekends and vacations.</p>
