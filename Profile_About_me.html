        <!--<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:medium;color:rgb(8, 8, 8)" >Maybe I will want to work alongside my studies but it is not certain. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, cooking, meditating and doing Yoga, I also love to travel and get to know new locations especially now that I moved to the Netherlands. During my studies I tend to focus mainly on my studies so I need to learn to combine my other interests together with them to be able to feel more relaxed. I will probably combine my meditations, cooking and yoga before or after the study days and the rest of my hobbies more on the weekends and vacations.</p></H3>
