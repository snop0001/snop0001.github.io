             <p class="Blog-Pos">I have read about my options and different paths I can take and took my time to understand
               what I want to do in my career. I sadly missed the webinars but I watched the recordings uploaded on the
                forum and maybe I will speak to ambassador students before the start of the semester. The background of 
                my experiance with computers and IT I already explained before.

            <h3 class="Blog-Pos">Motivate Your Study Choice</h3>
              <p class="Blog-Pos"> Computers always interested me, at school, I choose to focus on programming (I studies Java, assembler and visual 
                basic which we used to build a database). Later when I entered the military service which is obligatory in my country,
                 I did exams to enter the computer subjects, there I was sent to a course where I studied to become a Network manager,
                  so I was introduced more towards the hardware part of computers. I ended up serving in the rest of my service as a 
                  deputy commander of a computer center, project manager and as an infrastructure manager in a Data Center. Since my
                   release I have been working in IT support where I assisted clients with problems.
                  I am looking forward to get back into programming which is what made me fall in love with computers in the first place,
                  learning more languages and about all the other possibilities of IT. My main reason for enjoying programming is the 
                  possibility of creating something new, writing a code from scratch and tailor it to be able to do what we need it to 
                  or what is required

             <h3 class="Blog-Pos">After completing the Study</h3>
                <p class="Blog-Pos">After graduating, I will either enter a high tech company where I can be a programmer, 
                    a data analysis or a  software tester all of them interest me for now so I am not sure which I will 
                    focus on. Or I will continue my studies further either into a master's degree in software engineering 
                    or to study psychology and cognitive science which are subjects that in the end, I am hoping to combine
                     with the IT degree and knowledge ill earn in HZ to be able to create an advanced artificial intelligence 
                     being or a smart program to help people who have no access to psychologists or who cannot afford a proper 
                     treatment. I have many fields of interest and my goal is to be able to combine them to create something 
                     useful for humanity.
