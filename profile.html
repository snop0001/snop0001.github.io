        <h2>Personal information</h2>
        <p> My name is Shirel Snopik I am 23 years old. I come originally from Beer Sheva,Israel, the capital city of
          the Negev region
          in a very little country in the middle east. </p>
        
        <p> I speak 3.5 languages, Hebrew & Spanish from my home country and family, English from school and extra
          activities and a bit of Dutch.</p>
          
        <p> I moved to the Netherlands to live with my
          Partner of the past 5 and a half years, I am looking forward to become a part of the Netherlands in general
          and especially part of the community here.</p>
          
        <p> I believe that by studying at HZ and researching programming which is a subject that was always close to my
          heart Ill be able to achive all my goals in this new country.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>What I did before I arrived to the Netherlands? </h2>
        <br>
        <p> In my country we study 6 years of primary school and 6 of high school. In the last 3 years of high school
          you choose a "specialty" - subjects you will focus on and get extra credit for, I chose the computer science department
          and physics. </p>
         <br>
          <p> After I graduated from high school I entered my military service (in Israel it is obligatory to serve 2 years
          for women and 3 for men). In my service I was located at Jerusalem were I was in charge of server administration mainly.</p>
          <br>
         <p>  After taking a break of a few months after getting released from the IDF, I started working as a tech support in a military base as
          a civilian and took some courses in the university in my city, to improve my high school diploma and for fun, like "Relationships
          in Psycology's eyes", "Quantitative Thinking" and "Academic English". </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Extra-curricular activities</h2>
        <h3>Do you work/are you planning to work alongside your studies? What do you do in your spare time? How do you
          think
          you can combine this with studying? </h3>
        <p>Maybe I will want to work alongside my studies but it is not certain, I will need to combine my self studies
          for the Dutch
          Inburgeren Examen I need to take by the next 3 years together with my studies, I hope to pass these tests in
          the upcoming year
          so ill be able to focus fully just on the ICT studies.
          In my spare time I enjoy mainly doing the following:</p>

        <div class="inner-grid-hobbies">
          <div>
            <ul id="hobbies-list">
              <li>Yoga</li>
              <li>meditations</li>
              <li>Cooking</li>
              <li>Gaming</li>
              <li>Singing and dancing</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="par-hobbies">
            <p>I also love to travel and get to know new locations especially now that I moved to the Netherlands.
              During my
              studies I tend to focus mainly on my studies
              so I need to learn to combine my other interests together with them to be able to feel more relaxed. I
              will
              probably combine my meditations, cooking and yoga
              before or after the study days and the rest of my hobbies more on the weekends and vacations.</p>
